When founded in 1642, Montreal was a mission named Ville-Marie. Today, with 3.4 million inhabitants, it&apos;s a major inland port, an international metropolis and the world&apos;s second-largest French-speaking city. Its juxtaposition of French and British influences gives rise to an exuberant creativity, reflected in it&apos;s rich and festive cultural life! Montreal is an historic, yet modern city that features many cultural and seasonal activities along with wonderfulattractions and fantastic festivals.

The story of Montreal begins in 1535 with Jacques Cartier, who sailed from France in search of a route to Asia and discovered an island in the St Lawrence River. An Iroquois village called Hochelaga lay at the base of a 233-metre mountain which rose majestically from the middle of the island. From the summit of the mountain, which he named &#34;Mont-Royal&#34; Cartier could see miles of fertile plain through which the St Lawrence flowed..<a id="seemore" href="History.html">See More</a>
