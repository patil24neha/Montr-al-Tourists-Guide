<div id="Artintro">Classic European art and architectural influences meet with an urbane, design&#45;heavy aesthetic in Montreal and Quebec City.  Montreal really is as beautiful as it sounds and although my time here was brief, I was able to see enough for it to be put on my I Would Live Here list &#45; the highest accolade I give to a city when accessing if I like it or not.Here are some art highlights.</div>

It is an American architect, Bruce Price (1845&#45;1903), who is responsible for the most iconic building in the entire province of Quebec: Chateau Frontenac, Quebec City&#39;s visual center.&#34;The Chateau&#34; opened as a hotel in 1893, and with its castlelike architecture, soaring turrets, and romantic French-Renaissance mystery, it achieved its goal of becoming the most talked&#45;about accommodation in North America. Today this high-end property is managed by the Fairmont chain.
<br/>
<br/>
The Chateau was one of many similar&#45;styled hotels commissioned by the Canadian Pacific Railway in the late 19th century during construction of Canada is first transcontinental railway. As part of the same Canadian Pacific Railway project, Price also designed Montreal&#39;s Windsor Station; the Dalhousie Station in Montreal; the facade of Royal Victoria College in Montreal; and the Gare du Palais train station in Quebec City, whose turrets echo those of the Chateau Frontenac. As the leading practitioner of the chateau style, Price is sometimes credited with having made it the national look of Canada.
<br/>
<br/>
The Chateau Frontenac was built near the Citadel on which Frontenac had begun construction in the late 17th century. It covers the Saint&#45;Louis Forts and Chateaux archeological site. Situated on a large cape (Cap Diamant) it overhangs the St. Lawrence River and runs alongside the celebrated Plains of Abraham historic site where the battle for the conquest of Quebec took place in 1759 during the Seven Years War between Great Britain and France.Frontenac&#39;s coat of arms can be found on the exterior wall of the entranceway arch and at various other places in the hotel. On the vault of the entrance hall discerning visitors can admire the 350 year old stone emblazoned with a Maltese cross.

Inuit Art has gained tremendous recognition since 1949, when the first commercial exhibition took place in Montreal. After its success, the Government of Canada recognized the significant artistic potential of the Arctic people. Grants and cooperatives were created to promote and distribute Inuit art, allowing underprivileged communities to generate new sources of income. The result of this initiative has been the birth of many great artists who have found a medium to express their values, beliefs and traditions through artistic means.

Artist such as :

  <li>Barnabus</li>
  <li>Aqjangajuk Shaa</li>
  <li>Mathew Aqigaaq</li>
  <li>Judas Ullulaq</li>
  <li>Nuna Parr</li>
</ol>
<br/>
The Inuits work with the materials they have at hand: bone, ivory, leather, antler and especially stone. The Canadian Arctic is rich in minerals and the artists often extract the stones from the quarries themselves. The artists from the Central Arctic (Baker Lake and Arviat) primarily sculpt basalt. The artists from Baffin Island (Cape Dorset, Kimmirut and Iqualuit) for the most part sculpt serpentine and occasionally marble. Some artists prefer to use steatite (soap stone), a softer stone. There is not one stone that is particularly more precious than the other  and their availability varies according to region. The artists use traditional sculpting tools, such as the metal saw, the file, the scraper and sand paper.
