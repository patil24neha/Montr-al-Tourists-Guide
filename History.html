When founded in 1642, Montreal was a mission named Ville-Marie. Today, with 3.4 million inhabitants, it&apos;s a major inland port, an international metropolis and the world&apos;s second-largest French-speaking city. Its juxtaposition of French and British influences gives rise to an exuberant creativity, reflected in it&apos;s rich and festive cultural life! Montreal is an historic, yet modern city that features many cultural and seasonal activities along with wonderfulattractions and fantastic festivals.
<br/>
<br/>
The story of Montreal begins in 1535 with Jacques Cartier, who sailed from France in search of a route to Asia and discovered an island in the St Lawrence River. An Iroquois village called Hochelaga lay at the base of a 233-metre mountain which rose majestically from the middle of the island. From the summit of the mountain, which he named &#34;Mont-Royal&#34; Cartier could see miles of fertile plain through which the St Lawrence flowed. To his disappointment, however, the river was barred to the southwest by impassable rapids. These rapids were christened &#34;Lachine&#34; (which means China in the English language) because of the belief that beyond them lay the route to China.

<h2>From the beginning</h2>
<br/>

The Island of Montreal was long inhabited by the St Lawrence Iroquois, one of the tribes who formed the Five Nations Confederacy of Iroquois. In 1535 French explorer Jacques Cartier visited the Iroquois village of Hochelaga (Place of the Beaver) on the slopes of Mont Royal. In 1642 Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve founded the first permanent mission despite fierce resistance by the Iroquois. Intended as a base for converting aboriginal people to Christianity, this settlement quickly became a major hub of the fur trade. Quebec City became the capital of the French colony Nouvelle-France, while Montreal's voyageurs (trappers) established a network of trading posts into the hinterland. After the British conquest of Montreal in 1760, Scottish fur traders consolidated their power by founding the North West Company.

In the early 1990s Montreal was wracked by political uncertainty and economic decline. No one disputed that the city was ailing. The symptoms were everywhere: corporate offices closed down and moved their headquarters to other parts of Canada, shuttered shops lined downtown streets, and derelict factories and refineries rusted on the perimeter. Relations between anglophones and francophones, meanwhile, plumbed new depths after Quebec was denied a special status in Canada.

<h2>Evolution of the modern city</h2>

As Canada expanded, Montreal became the headquarters of the two transcontinental railways: the Canadian Pacific Railway, which had reached Port Moody, British Columbia (just outside Vancouver), by 1886, and the Canadian National Railway, which moved its headquarters from Toronto in 1923. By developing many branch lines, those railways opened up new territory for farming, forestry, and mining and, in turn, increased population and the demand for finished goods. Montreal had its first electric lighting in 1882, its first electric tramways in 1892, and the first automobiles along its streets and movie houses along its sidewalks in 1903.

In 1976 this lingering discontent helped to elect Rene Levesque and his Parti Qu&#233;b&#233;cois, committed to the goal of independence for the province. The following year the Qu&#233;bec assembly passed Bill 101, which not only made French the sole official language of Quebec, but also stipulated that all immigrants enroll their children in French-language schools. The trickle of anglophone refugees turned into a flood. Alliance Qu&#233;bec, an English rights group, estimates that between 300, 000 and 400, 000 anglos left Quebec during that period.
