<h2>#1 Le Plateau-Mont-Royal</h2>

<br/>
<p>&#34;The Plateau&#34;is where many Montr&#233;alers feel most at home away from downtown&#39;s chattering pace and the more touristed Vieux-Montreal. It&#39;s where many locals dine, shop, play, and live.Bounded roughly by rue Sherbrooke to the south, boulevard St-Joseph to the north, avenue Papineau to the east, and rue St-Urbain to the west.
<br/>
<br/>
Rue St-Denis runs the length of the district from south to north and is the thumping central artery of Francophone Montr&#233;al, to French-speaking Montr&#233;al as boulevard St-Germain is to Paris. It is thick with bistros. There are no museums, important galleries on St-Denis, nor the architecture notable.</p>

<h2>#2 Old Montreal</h2>

<br/>
<p>Today, the city&#39;s oldest district, founded as a fur trading post in 1605 by Samuel de Champlain, is a melange of shops, bars and sidewalk cafes that attracts visitors and locals in equal measure.
It&#39;s also become the hip place to crash on a Montreal sojourn and the new Hotel William Gray creatively adapting old buildings into cool places to stay.
<br/>
<br/>
Thirty years ago, this wasn&#39;t the case. Many of the Vieux-Montreal structures were vacant, and most of the residents had fled to other areas, draining the neighborhood of life. In recent years people began renovating them into modern business, entertainment and residential spaces.</p>

<div class="block">
<h2>#3 Quartier Latin</h2>
<img src="neighborhood3.jpg" alt="Quartier Latin" width="500" height="210"/>
<br/>
<p>The southern end of rue St-Denis runs near the concrete campus of the Universite du Quebec &#224; Montreal. This is the Latin Quarter and decidedly student-oriented, rife with the messiness that characterizes student. Locals seem nonplussed by the numbers of drug addicts around the Berri-UQAM Metro entrances, but outsiders may find the scene intimidating.
<br/>
<br/>
The Grande Bibliotheque du Quebec was opened in the area in 2005, joining the Cinematheque quebecoise. The National Film Board of Canada&#39;s CineRobotheque facility was based until April 2012, when it was closed as part of cuts imposed by the 2012 Canadian federal budget.</p>
